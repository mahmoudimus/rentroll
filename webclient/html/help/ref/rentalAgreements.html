                Rental Agreements define who rents what for how much and over what
                period of time. Rental Agreements
                have one or more Payors and one or more Users. Payors are financially
                responsible for the rent. Users are those who have access to whatever
                is being rented. There can be one or more Rentables (rented items)
                associated with the Rental Agreement.
