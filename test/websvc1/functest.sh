#  TEST a19 - a20
#  Add a GLAccount of the same name to multiple businesses.  This test
#  was added as a result of a bug found in production where the Lockbox
#  account could not be created on PAC because it had been created in REX
#  and the db query was missing the BID, so it searched all Accounts rather
#  than just the accounts in the business being edited.
#
#  Scenario:
#		Add an account named "Lockbox" to REX and to PAC
#
#  Expected Results:
#	1.	There should be no error in adding the account to either business.
#       Even though the account is named "Lockbox" in both cases, it is not
#       a problem because they are in different businesses.
