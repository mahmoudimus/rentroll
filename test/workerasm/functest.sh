#  TEST 00
#  Scenario: The database we load has Rental Agreement 2 with a stop date
#       2/1/2018.  Assessment ASMID=3 charges to Rental Agreement 2. It
#       recurs and has a Stop Date of 3/1/2018 (the RA's original stop date).
#       RentalAgreement 2 was modified to end on 2/1/2018. Its assessments were
#       not adjusted.  This test makes sure that if a recurring assessment
#       continues past its associated RentalAgreement stop date, the worker
#       that creates instances of recurring assessments does not create
#       new assessment instances that go beyond the RentalAgreement's end
#       date.
#
#       When the worker code is called, simulating the date as 2/1/2018. It
#       should NOT add a new assessment instance.
#
#  Expected Result:
#	1.	When the worker code is called, simulating the date as 2/1/2018. It
#       should NOT add a new assessment instance. So, the Assessment report
#       should NOT show a $3750 instance for Feb.
