How To Use This Directory

Developers: Please add notes here to anything that is missing.

1. Add a directory for each area of focus on your functional
   tests.

2. Using the functions in ./share/base.sh will save you a lot
   of time and effort. Try to use them as much as possible. If
   there is some functionality you need that does not exist in
   base.sh, add it to base.sh rather than doing one-off work in
   your directory.

3. Makefiles MUST support the targets 'clean', 'package', and
   'test'.

4. Each test directory needs to be self-contained - it must not
   depend on the output of other tests.  If you have an exception
   to this, please contact sman@accordinterests.com and let's
   discuss.

5. Update dbfiles.txt if your test uses a .sql file that you save
   in your test directory.

6. If you make a change the the rentroll schema, please update dbmod.sh
   with the ALTER statements (or whatever) needed to bring existing
   databases in sync with the updated schema. Then run dbmod.sh to
   bring all the test databases up to date. Once you have run dbmode.sh
   move your changes into the comments above along with the date that
   you applied them.  This will serve as notes for updating the
   production schemas.

7. If you create a .sql file to use as the database for your functional
   test, you need to add the filename to dbfiles.txt.
   This will ensure that the schema is correct before any of the
   functional tests are run during 'make test'.

8. If you want to check the schemas to see that they are in sync
   you can run localcmp.sh .  This script compares the schema of all
   the database file names in the script's array. It generates
   dbreport.txt .

9. Do not push files to the repo if localcmp.sh fails, fix them.

10. The files sqlschema/fixprod.sh and sqlschema/fixrcpts.sh are scripts
    that update the production databases based on all the changes we make.
    You will need to update them as well as dbmod.sh.

11. All test cases should be documented. Describe what the test
    does and what the expected results are.  If you don't do this
    you probably won't remember the details of what you were doing
    six months after you wrote it and one of your code changes
    breaks the test.

12. The main script for running the test is named functest.sh by
    convention.  Individual tests within functest.sh can be created
    in sections referred to by name. This makes them easier to
    document, and it makes it possible to run them individually
    for debugging purposes. A good example of this can be seen in
    ./raflow/f2ra/functest.sh

    * There are many environment variables used within the functions in
      base.sh. You can set these variables prior to calling the functions
      as needed.  They need to all be documented, but as of this writing
      they are not.  Here are some important env vars that you must understand
      before writing or debugging tests.

      - RENTROLLSERVERNOW
        This one can cause considerable confusion if you are not aware of it.
        There is a function called rlib.Now() which is used in some places as
        a replacement for time.Now().  Under VERY special conditions, it can
        return a value which is NOT the system time.  Safeguards have been
        put in place so that this cannot happen in production. But it will
        happen in the development environment. For testing it is used to
        control the "current" date that is used when expanding past instances
        of repeating sequences (assessments, tasklists, ...).  The problem
        with expanding past instances is that as time progresses -- days, weeks,
        and months-- after the tests have been written the number of instances
        created will change. This will cause ASMIDs to change, it will cause
        report output and other output to change significantly over time. Thus,
        the "good" files no longer work (or they would need to be constantly
        updated). To address this, you can set the date that you want
        rlib.Now() to return.  This will cause the expansions to return a
        predictable number of instances and the tests will not need to be
        updated as time progresses.  This variable is used extensively in
        ./raflow/f2ra/functest.sh
