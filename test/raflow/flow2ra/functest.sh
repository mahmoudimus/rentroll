#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  TEST a
#  An existing rental agreement (RAID=1) is being amended. This test
#  verifies that all assessments from RAID=1 to the new RAID (24) are correct.
#  It also verifies that payments are properly filtered. For example,
#  if the original agreement there is a Security Deposit request in
#  September. This security deposit is not in the fees for the amended
#  Rental Agreement, so it should be reversed in the old rental agreement
#
#  Scenario:
#  The flow for RAID 1 is updated to the active state causing an amended
#  Rental Agreement (RAID=24) to be created.
#  RAID  1 - AgreementStart = 2/13/2018,  AgreementStop = 3/1/2020
#  RAID 24 - AgreementStart = 8/20/2018,  AgreementStop = 3/1/2020
#            The flow used to create RAID 24 has no links between its fees and
#            the assessments in RAID 1. So, the handling tests how "unlinked"
#            assessments are handled when amending a rental agreement.
#
#  Expected Results:
#   1.  All RAID 1 recurring assessment definitions that overlap the period
#       8/8/2018 - 3/1/2020 must have their stop date set to 8/8/201
#   2.  The RAID 1 rent assessment has already occured, and it has been paid.
#       Same for the RAID 1 pet rent. The assessments must be reversed and the
#       payments must become available.
#   3.  There is a Security Deposit assessment for RAID 1 due on 9/20 in the
#       old rental agreement. It is not in the fees list for the RefNo, so it
#       should be reversed in RAID 1 and not present in RAID 24

#  TEST b
#  This is just like test a except that the $4500 security deposit assessment
#  from the origin RA (RAID 2) is kept.  Since its time frame falls into that
#  of the amended Rental Agreement, it becomes part of that rental agreement.
#
#  Scenario:
#  RAID  2 - AgreementStart = 2/13/2018,  AgreementStop = 3/1/2020
#  RAID 25 - AgreementStart = 8/20/2018,  AgreementStop = 3/1/2020
#            Verify that the Security Deposit on 9/20 is linked to the new
#            rental agreement.
#
#  Expected Results:
#   1.  ASMID 402 (which was charged to RAID 1) should be reversed and a new
#       one should be created (ASMID 412) associated with the amended RAID (25)
#       8/8/2018 - 3/1/2020 must have their stop date set to 8/8/201

#  TEST d
#  This tests updating a rental agreement with the term dates the same as
#  the original rental agreement. In this case we want the old rental agreement
#  to start and stop on the same day (so there is a record of this agreement)
#  and the amended agreement to start on the same day and end on the date that
#  the parent agreement eneded. For good measure, I made one change to a pet:
#  the cat named BatMan is renamed to Crappy.
#
#  Scenario:
#  RAID  4 - AgreementStart = 2/13/2018,  AgreementStop = 3/1/2020
#            Change pet BatMan to Crappy
#  RAID 25 - AgreementStart = 8/20/2018,  AgreementStop = 3/1/2020
#            Pet should be named Crappy
#

#   1.  RAID 4 should start and stop on 2/13.
#   2.  All assessments associated with RA
#       Same for the RAID 1 pet rent. The assessments must be reversed and the
